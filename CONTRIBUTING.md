### Creating Issues

If you find a bug in the project, or have an idea for a feature, you can create an issue.
But before you do, please search the existing issues to see if someone else has already beat you to it.
If you find a similar issue, please upvote it. Consider adding your experience to the discussion.
For bugs also consider adding your use case as a comment to the issue.
If you can't find an issue that matches what you've found, feel free to create a new one.

## Pull requests

If you want to contribute to the project, you can create a pull request.
Before you spend a lot of time on a pull request,
it is recommended to discuss the problem and solution in an issue first.
This will greatly increase alignment of your PR with the project goals and reduce the chance of wasted effort.
